Advent of code 2023

I'll make this short and sweet:

* You need cargo to run this since it's been written in rust.

* You run a specific part of a specific day as follows:
`cargo run --release [day] [part]`
  Thus, executing day 3 part 2 would be done as follows:
  `cargo run --release 3 2`
 
Hopefully that's simple enough, enjoy!
